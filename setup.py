    description='CentralConnect is a specialized module crafted to complement the DataMiner package, aiming to centralize and secure the management of credentials and database connections. As a core component, it enables seamless interactions across various databases and network infrastructures. CentralConnect adopts a centralized framework, streamlining the sharing of credentials in parallel or grid-based architectures. This proves particularly beneficial when deploying updated instructions across multiple servers, allowing them to leverage a unified, encrypted PostgreSQL 15+ database. This database efficiently handles host configurations and API key management, making CentralConnect an invaluable tool in simplifying and securing large-scale server operations.'
